Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.  It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.  Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.  [view source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

Cateogories of Machine Learning include Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement and Clustering learning.

Supervised learning algorithms can be divided into two categories:

- Regression
- Classification

Unsupervised learning can be divided into two categories:

- Dimensionality Reduction
- Clustering

Another popular type of Machine Learning is Reinforcement Learning which is used for learning tasks or for game AI.  
See the diagram above. 

Some common machine learning algorithms are:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Ensemble Methods and Random Forest
- KNN K-Means
- Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms
  - Principal Component Analysis
- Singular Value Decomposition
- Reinforcement Learning

You can check out [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) for a complete guide of the most popular machine learning algorithms. 

For statistics check the [data analyst roadmap](https://github.com/66daysofdata/Resources/tree/main/Data%20Analyst), for calculus and linear algebra see the [data science roadmap](https://github.com/66daysofdata/Resources/tree/main/Data%20Science), and for other specializations such as neural networks, natural language processing, reinforcement learning and computer vision please see the [deep learning roadmap](https://github.com/66daysofdata/Resources/tree/main/Deep%20Learning).

Here, we will focus mainly in supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms,  machine learning techniques such as feature engineering and feature selection, model selection and evaluation.

**Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning**

| Parameters | Supervised machine learning technique | Unsupervised machine learning technique |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------| 
|Input Data	| Algorithms are trained using labeled data.| Algorithms are used against data which is not labeled. |
Computational Complexity | Supervised learning is a simpler method. |	Unsupervised learning is computationally complex. |
Accuracy | Highly accurate and trustworthy method. | Less accurate and trustworthy method. |
