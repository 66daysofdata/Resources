⚙⚙⚙🚀🚀🏗🏗

Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.  It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.  Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.  [view source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

Cateogories of Machine Learning algorithms include supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement and clustering.

 Supervised learning algorithms can be divided into two categories:

- Regression
- Classification

Some common machine learning algorithms are:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Suport Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naive Bayes Classification
- Random Forest
- Ensemble Methods
- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/)
- KNN K-Means
- Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms
  - Principal Component Analysis
- Singular Value Decomposition
- Reinforcement Learning

You can check out [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) for a complete guide of all the machine learning models. 

For statistics check the [data analyst section](https://github.com/66daysofdata/Resources/tree/main/Data%20Analyst), for calculus and linear algebra see the [data science section](https://github.com/66daysofdata/Resources/tree/main/Data%20Science), and for other specializations such as neural networks, natural language processing, reinforcement learning and computer vision please see the [deep learning section](https://github.com/66daysofdata/Resources/tree/main/Deep%20Learning).

Here, we will focus mainly in machine learning techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, feature engineering and selection, model selection and evaluation.

**Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning**

| Parameters | Supervised machine learning technique | Unsupervised machine learning technique |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------| 
|Input Data	| Algorithms are trained using labeled data.| Algorithms are used against data which is not labeled. |
Computational Complexity | Supervised learning is a simpler method. |	Unsupervised learning is computationally complex. |
Accuracy | Highly accurate and trustworthy method. | Less accurate and trustworthy method. |
