# Deep Learning Roadmap

🎯🎯🎯🐱‍👤✨✨✨

Deep Learning also known as (deep structured learning) is a subset of Machine Learning which in turn is a subset of Artificial Intelligence, which is a part of a greater field of Computer Science. [1]

It is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on Artificial Neural Networks with representation learning.  Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. [1][2]  

Natural Language Processing will be included in the Deep Learning roadmap because now a days is used heavily with big data.  Natural Language Processing can use Deep Learning techiques such as ANNs, RNNs and LSTMs for building chatbots for instance.  However, it can also be consider a separate field since it involves Linguistics, Sentiment Analysis, Information Extraction and Retrieval just to name a few. [2]

Thus, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing have some overlaps.  Yet, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing rely heavily on the tools use for Machine Learning practices.
