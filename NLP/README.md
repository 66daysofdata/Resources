What is Natural Language Processing?

Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science‚Äîand more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI‚Äîconcerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. Some applications used in NLP are spam detection, machine translation, virtual agents/chatbots, text summarization and social media sentiment analysis.
