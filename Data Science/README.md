Data science is an interdisciplinary field that includes knowledge of: 

- Programming in languages such as:
    - Python (Recommended)
    - R
    - Scala
    - Julia

Note: For now the majority of resources will be in the python language but others languages such R will come soon 😀🤞

- An understanding of:
    - Data Structures and Algorithms
    - Object Oriented Programming
    - Functional Programming
    
- Version Control
    - Git
    - Gitlab

    - Testing and debugging
 
 - Machine Learning Deployment (Also part of DE and DevOps)
    - Flask
    - FastAPI
    - Streamlit
       
As a consequence, some Data Science specializations overlap and some of their subfields can be studied separately.
Such is the case for Data Analyst, Machine Learning, Deep learning Engineer and as well as Data Engineers.  One of the first step to take if you are a beginner is to follow the Data Analyst, then proceed to Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and finally the Data Engineering roadmap.

Moreover, Here, you will find some resources to learn Data Science that are not included in the other subfields roadmaps.
If you feel that you do not see what you are looking for please take a look at the other roadmap resources available.
